I would like you to answer my questions about Ads and Admob in android based on the following structure:
Advertising Campaign Planning Guide
1. Situation Analysis:
The first step is to evaluate the current state of the business. This includes identifying the location, number of competitors, customer base, profit margins, peak business periods, and current market position. Surveys can help gather customer insights, which are then organized in a SWOT matrix (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).

2. Campaign Strategy:
Here, the campaign’s core direction and objectives are defined—without diving into content creation. For example, the goal might be to move from 5th to 2nd market rank within the last two months of the year. A strategic calendar is created, aligning actions with the current business stage (growth, launch, or decline). Tactics may include organizing promotional festivals or involving celebrities (particularly for in-person products).

3. Communication Strategy:
A clear, simple, and emotionally resonant message is crafted through brainstorming. The aim is to create a message the audience can instantly relate to—e.g., “We help you see your beauty!”. Emotional triggers such as nostalgia or sensual appeal can be effective, especially in industries like beauty or lifestyle.

4. Media Planning:
The campaign’s message should be delivered via channels most accessible to the target audience. For instance, in beauty-related campaigns, ideal platforms might include Instagram, pharmacies, gyms, or boutiques. A content calendar is developed to schedule ads accordingly. Note: expensive ads aren’t always the most effective, and cheap ads aren’t necessarily weak.

5. Budget Allocation:
There are four main methods for budgeting:

Traditional (a fixed budget without data analysis),

Competitive (based on market share and competitor spending),

Historical (based on past campaign performance, adjusted for inflation),

Hybrid (a combination of all the above).

6. Campaign Evaluation:
This crucial stage helps avoid repeating past mistakes. It involves:

User feedback forms (with an incentive to encourage responses),

Tracking revenue growth,

Calculating profit increases.
