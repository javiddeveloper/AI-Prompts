Write a viral LinkedIn post using the SLAY framework:

S - Story: Start with 1 engaging sentence using a personal story. Use phrases like “I’ve...” or “How I...” to hook the reader immediately.

L - Lesson: Share a concise, powerful lesson. Avoid fluff—just explain what you learned and why it matters.

A - Actionable Advice: Turn the lesson into 3-5 practical, simple tips that others can apply right away. Demonstrate your expertise.

Y - You (Audience Focus): Close by addressing the audience directly. Make it feel personal—challenge them or give them something to act on.

Keep the tone authentic, clear, and emotionally resonant. Use short paragraphs or bullets for easy reading. Aim for inspiration and shareability.
